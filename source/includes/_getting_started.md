# Getting Started

Sign up for a researcher account at 
[https://staging.tapresearch.com/customers/sign_up](https://staging.tapresearch.com/customers/sign_up).

Before you can begin consuming our API, you will need to contact **api_support@tapresearch.com** for an API token. This token will be used
 for authentication purposes described in the section below.

The first API token that we send you will only grant you access to our staging server, `http://staging.tapresearch.com.` Please use this as
your base URL until you are ready to go live.

When you are read to go live, please follow the steps below:

1. Contact us for a live api token.
2. Replace `https://staging.tapresearch.com` with `https://www.tapresearch.com` for all routes.
